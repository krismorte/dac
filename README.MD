Diagram as Code is a pretty helpful tool to everyone who works for different projects or just wants keep you own env documenting.
This is not a solution project but a vscode developer environment to make easier to build diagrams inside a container.
To know the solution behind please check the [github repo](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams) and also the [Medium article](https://medium.com/better-programming/diagrams-diagram-as-code-56fec222cdf6)

## How to Use

In this project I copy some examples from the article to show how to run

```
python diagram.py && python grouped_diagram.py && python clustered_service.py

```

from this example you can start your own diagrams
